  @section sec_inet_overview Overview
  @image html inetlib_overview.png

  The Internet stack enables UDP & UDP lite based communication with a remote
  host. A client can receive or transmit data using the EndPoint abstraction
  which is used to identify the 5 tuple <transport protocol, local IP address,
  local port, remote IP address, remote port> to be used for packet creation.
      - Only Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is supported at the network
        layer.
          - Support for fragmentation and reassembly
          - Ability to configure the DSCP field to ensure preference for packets
            in the network
      - ARP is supported for resolving H/W (MAC) addresses
      - ICMPv4 – Support for receiving Redirect, Echo Request,
                 Destination Unreachable & Time Exceeded and for transmitting
                 Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable & Time Exceeded messages.
      - The stack implements a true Internet ‘host’ as defined by RFC 1122 with
        no support for routing between multiple interfaces and limited support
        for multi-homing.
      - The entire set of end points and network interfaces are defined in the
        system. INET accesses these end points and interfaces via the APIs
        defined by the system layer.

  @section sec_comp_fsm State Machine
  The Internet stack library is modeled as a memory/state less module.

@limitations
   - The Internet stack only supports Ethernet or Ethernet like interfaces
   - All endpoints, interfaces and reassembly buffers for Rx are supposed to be
     statically allocated by the system and provided to INET via a defined
     interface
   - No support for loopback interface
   - No support for connection oriented transport (TCP)
   - No support for IPv6 or related protocols
   - No support for dynamic IP assignment or Auto-IP
   - No support for IGMP
   - Only a single task handles transmission for an end point

/** @brief Send data using UDP

    @pre None

    This API is used to make a request to the Internet stack to transmit
    the data provided in the buffer using UDP protocol (as configured in
    the system configuration) to the remote end. In case the provided buffer
    is larger than the L2 MTU, it might be fragmented and sent. In case enough
    network buffers are not available, the API will return BCM_ERR_BUSY and the
    client is expected to resume transmission with the UDP_Process API.
