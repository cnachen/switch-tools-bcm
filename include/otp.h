    @section sec_otp_overview Overview
    @todo image html otp_overview.jpg "OTP driver overview"
    OTP driver manages OTP controller in the system.

    OTP driver supports following operations on the OTP controller:
    - OTP read
    - OTP write

    @section sec_otp_fsm State Machine
    This section describes driver state machines for status transition during
    otp driver operation.
    @todo image html otp_state_machine.jpg "OTP driver state machine"
    - #OTP_DRVSTATE_UNINIT: OTP driver uninitialized or de-initialized after
      initialization.
    - #OTP_DRVSTATE_INIT: OTP driver is initialized

    @section sec_otp_seq Sequence Diagrams
    This section describes sequence diagrams for APIs to better understand OTP
    driver interface. Sequence diagrams are based on synchronous behavior of
    the interface.

    @subsection subsec_otp_use_case_seq OTP Driver Use Case sequence
    The following sequence diagram depicts the typical use case sequence for
    OTP APIs.
