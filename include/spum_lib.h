/**
    @brief SPUM driver context handle

    The API's provided by this library allow the clients to run the
    various crypto/auth algorithms in an INIT->UPDATE->FINISH fashion. That is,
    instead of running a crypto/auth algorithm on the entire input data buffer
    in one shot, one can break the buffer up into multiple small chunks and
    call the update() API to process these smaller chunks one at a time.
    To process the last chunk of data, the client would call the finish() API to
    let the driver know that the input data has been exhausted, and the final
    results should now be computed.

    To enable this mode of operation, algorithm execution states will have to be
    tracked by the driver across these update calls, and the hardware needs to be
    setup correctly with the updated state during the job submission. A SPUM driver
    context is a container for all such state.

    One creates a SPUM driver context by calling the @ref SPUM_CreateContext API. The
    crypto/auth algorithms to run are specified at this point. A handle to this context
    is returned to the client.

    The client may then call @ref SPUM_Update zero or more times against this context
    with small chunks of input data. The processing is terminated by the client by a
    call to @ref SPUM_Finish.

    The context handle is automatically invalidated as soon as the @ref SPUM_Finish
    is successfully issued by the client. The invalidation also happens if any of the
    jobs issued against this context cause the hardware to raise errors.
