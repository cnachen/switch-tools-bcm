    Atomic APIs shall be used where thread critical data is being updated and
    needs exclusive access. Atomic APIs are build on top of ARM special
    instructions like LDREX/STREX/CLREX which provide exclusive access to a
    memory by using local/global monitor.

    @limitations  It is user responsibility to ensure that addresses passed to
    these APIs are normal cached memory (not device memory).
