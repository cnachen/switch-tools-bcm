/** @brief Verify the RSASSA-PSS signature for an object
 *
 * @details Given a signature, the modulus of the key alleged to have been used for
 *          signing and the object to which the signature is alleged to correspond, check
 *          that the signature is indeed the result of signing the object with the key
 *          using the RSASSA-PSS algorithm. We expect the signature and key modulus to be
 *          SEC_S_SIGNATURE and SEC_S_MODULUS bits respectively.Some 2048 bytes of stack
 *          memory shall be used for computation.
 *
 * @param [in] aSignature     the signature
 * @param [in] aSiglen        the length of the signature in bytes
 * @param [in] aPublicKey     the modulus of the key used to create the signature
 * @param [in] aPubLen        the length of the modulus in bytes
 * @param [in] aMsg            the non-recoverable (appended) object that was signed
 * @param [in] aMsgLen         the length of the signed object in bytes
 * @param [out] aStatus       RSA_SUCCESS if the signature was verified or the error
 *                            status mentioned in RSA_Status based on the error
 * @retval                    BCM_ERR_OK for success: BCM_ERR_AUTH_FAILED for errors
