/** @brief Copy memory

    This API is used to read-from or write-to memory/peripheral register.
    Multiple accesses are performed on consecutive ones based on the access
    width chosen.
    Examples:
    1. Read can be performed by specifying the read start address as the source
    pointer and by providing a buffer, to read-to, as the destination pointer.
    2. Write can be performed by providing a buffer with content to write-to a
    contiguous chun of memory/peripheral registers specified as the destination
    start address.

    @behavior Sync, Re-entrant

    @pre None

    @param[in]      aSrc        Source start address
