/** @brief Advance the job execution

    A function implementing this interface is supplied by the client
    driver in an @ref HSMDRVSCHED_DriverCallbacksType instance.

    To execute a given job, several HW invocations might be necessary.
    The design of this interface facilitates this.

    The scheduler starts a new job with an invocation of this supplied function.
    The client driver is then expected to perform any HW operations it needs,
    update the job state reflecting the progress made, and return #BCM_ERR_BUSY
    indicating that the HW is now executing the issued work.

    When the HW finishes the execution of the work submitted above, the client
    driver should call @ref HSMDRVSCHED_SchedNext (perhaps from an ISR). The scheduler
    then invokes this routine again.

    At this point, the client driver may perform any furthur HW operations and
    return #BCM_ERR_BUSY. In this case, the client driver is again expected to
    call @ref HSMDRVSCHED_SchedNext once the submitted work finishes executing
    on the HW and the cycle repeats. Or, the client driver return any other error
    code - which tells the scheduler that the job may be marked as completed, and
    the error returned here is ultimately returned to the client of this library when
    @ref HSMDRVSCHED_JobQueueGetStatus is called. The client driver is expected to
    perform any necessary cleanup before returning to the scheduler in the second
    case.
