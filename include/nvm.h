    @section sec_nvm_overview Overview
    @image html nvm_overview.jpg "NVM Server Layers"
    NVM Service is thin interface layer which supports queuing of flash
    operation requests from the multiple clients for same flash controller.
    Flash operation requests are queued to flash manager message queue  and upon
    completion, client is signaled. Upon signaling, client shall check the
    status of the request by calling #NVM_GetStatus.

    Flash manager support following flash operations:
    - Flash initialization (with flash read lane configuration)
    - Flash read
    - Flash write
    - Flash erase
    - Flash compare
    - Flash blank check
    - Flash de-initialization

    @section sec_nvm_fsm State Machine
    @image html nvm_state_machine.jpg "Flash manager state machine"

    Flash manager states:
    - #NVM_STATE_UNINIT: Flash manager uninitialized or de-initialized after
    initialization.
    - #NVM_STATE_IDLE: Flash manager is initialized and currently no
    operation request in progress.
    - #NVM_STATE_BUSY: Flash manager is busy in processing operation request

    @note Any operation request queued after flash manager de-initialization
    request and before flash manager is de-initialized (Flash manager moves to
    #NVM_STATE_UNINIT) shall be marked failed with #NVM_OP_RESULT_FAILED.

    @section sec_nvm_seq Sequence Diagrams
    This section describes use case diagram for flash manager.

    Note that APIs like #NVM_Erase, #NVM_Write, #NVM_Compare,
    #NVM_BlankCheck shall follow same sequence as #NVM_Read.
