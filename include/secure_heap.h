    @{
    We provide a rather simple interface to work with the secure heap.
    The clients get to allocate memory from the secure heap and free it when
    they are done. They can pin their allocations to obtain the CPU and DMA
    addresses of the storage backing the said allocations. Unpinning invalidates
    those CPU and DMA addresses.

    The library is statically initialized and therefore, there is no runtime API to
    perform any initialization operations.
